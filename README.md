# Your Passkey is Weak

This repository and its contents were created to highlight the inherent weakness of synced passkeys.  There is an accompanying website at [www.yourpasskeyisweak.com](www.yourpasskeyisweak.com) with more details, research, and proposed remedies.

It is important to note that to the best of our knowledge, **ALL** password managers that stored synced passkeys are vulnerable to this attack. We only chose these two as indictive examples: Chrome as the most popular and Bitwarden as a more trusted, open-source solution.

# The Attack
Synced passkeys break a fundamental security assumption of public-key cryptography: never lose control of your public key. By copying this key to *every* computer that the user logs into, the attack surface quickly becomes untenable. Indeed, the attacker herself can simply log in as the victim and get access to their "phishing-resistant" passkey.
